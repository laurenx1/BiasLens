We created a research project that studied the sensationalism in AI vs. web 
recommendations of news articles by analyzing the ability of these news 
articles to grab the attention of college students. Our survey collects a 
variety of student attributes, such as age, house, major, and graduation year. 
Then, we have survey takers select 5 articles each for 8 health-related 
keywords, taken from our selection of the top 15 web-retrieved and top 15 
AI-retrieved articles on the 8 health-related keywords. 
We present results in terms of student demographics (grouped by major, age, 
year of graduation, and house) and in terms of overall student statistics. We 
also allow students to view their own statistics. We hope that in this way, we 
can reinforce in students the importance of thinking critically about the
validity of the news they consume in a world oversaturated with false headlines
and bad-faith reporting.
